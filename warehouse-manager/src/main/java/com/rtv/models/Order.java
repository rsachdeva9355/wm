    //TODO - Do I need to keep each data member corresponding to the json keys or would setters and getters suffice?

    //TODO - How do I map the data here to the DOs? Do I create two different kind of constructors?
    //One with DO objects as params and the other with the data members that go in them

    //TODO - Orders ka DAO kaha hoga? Jo GET call k liye dhund k laega?
